// * Make a JavaScript file called `bands.js` that exports an object of music genres and bands
const  bands= {
    rap: "Drake",
    rock: "Green day",
    country:"Lil NAs X"  

}


module.export = {
    bands:bands
};

// * Require this JavaScript file in `run.js`, loop over the values, and console.log them.
// * **Note**: If you are having trouble with looping through objects, please google `how to loop through objects in javascript` to get yourself in the right direction!
// * Utilize a `for/in statement` to loop through the object and call a single `console.log()` that will output all of your bands. Do not write anymore than ONE console.log() within your code (it will go inside for/in loop)
// * Make sure the program runs properly when entered into the terminal like this:
//   ```bash
//   node run.js
//   ```
// * And that the output looks something like the below:
//   ```bash
//   A punk band is Green Day
//   A rap band is Run DMC
//   A classic band is Led Zeppelin
